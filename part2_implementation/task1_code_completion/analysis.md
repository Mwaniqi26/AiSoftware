### Analysis: Manual vs Copilot Code

The manual version uses a lambda with `x[key]`, which will raise a KeyError if the key is missing.
The Copilot-generated version uses `d.get(key, '')`, which adds fault tolerance by providing a default value.
In terms of performance, both use Python’s built-in `sorted()` function and are similarly efficient for small to medium lists.

However, Copilot’s version is slightly safer in production scenarios where key consistency isn't guaranteed.
