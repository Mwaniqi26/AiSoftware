### AI in Automated Testing

Using Selenium IDE or Testim.io, we can automate login test cases for both valid and invalid inputs.
AI-powered test tools improve coverage by automatically updating tests when the UI changes and suggesting new edge cases based on test history.

This reduces manual effort and ensures better regression testing.
